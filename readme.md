# To run

Use `./runme.sh` on command line.

# Troubleshooting

If you receive an error stating that you don't have permissions to run `runme.sh`, but your permissions indicate you should be able to run the file, check whether the file is executable.

`ls -alh`

To make executable: 

`chmod 755 runme.sh`
